/// App icons : up to 3 layers for 3d effect
///
/// Interactive elements(like buttons) : default size of interactive is 44x44 pt, for spatial it needs 60x60, so we need to add 8pt of space on each side
///
/// Elements must have at least 4pt of space between them
///
/// Sheets/modal : close button on top-left corner
